# Attack-Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld
Implementation of cryptanalysis of Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld public key protocol in Python

The program AttackAAG.py has a function called GCP(A,B) that solves the conjugacy search problem in free group of rank 2 for two sets A and B. It is based on the work of "Bridson, M. R., & Howie, J. (2005). Conjugacy of finite subsets in hyperbolic groups. International Journal of Algebra and Computation, 15(04), 725-756". The complexity of AttackAAG.py is linear.
